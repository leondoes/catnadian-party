            <h1>Catnadian Political Party Manifesto</h1>
            <p>Welcome to the purr-fect vision of the future! Our Catnadian Political Party stands for the following delightful decrees:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>More Napping Spots:</strong> Every public space will have cozy sunlit spots designated for napping.</li>
                <li><strong>Unlimited Catnip:</strong> Catnip dispensaries at every corner, ensuring all cats have access to premium, organic catnip.</li>
                <li><strong>Feline Freedom Act:</strong> Laws enacted to ensure cats have the freedom to roam, nap, and play as they please.</li>
                <li><strong>Scratch Post Subsidies:</strong> Government-funded scratch posts in every home to ensure the happiness and well-being of our feline friends.</li>
                <li><strong>Yarn Ball Stimulus:</strong> A yarn ball in every household, because play is just as important as work!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Join us in making the Catnadian dream a reality for all felines!</p>
